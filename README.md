# SQLite DB from Census Special Tabulation on Citizen and Voting Age Population

The Citizen Voting Age Population by Race and Ethnicity (CVAP) is a special tabulation of American Community Survey (ACS) data. The original source of the data is <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap.html>.

Note the the publication year is two years behind the ACS year. That is, the 2019 CVAP is based on 2013-2017 5-Year ACS data, and includes a file named `CVAP_2013-2017_ACS_csv_files.zip`. The user would request this file by specifying the final year of the period, 2017.
